## Smart Healthcare: CPS for stress Detection
Smart Wearable Devices played a crucial role in the industrial revolution, during which Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things developed increasingly with the need for collaboration between humans and technology. In particular, the development of nanotechnologies and the usage of sensors previously dedicated to medical fields only led to the increase of the marketplace of intelligent healthcare devices to allow everyone to monitor necessary biometric measures and prevent many dangerous situations. 

However, many scientists are still investigating the proposal of intelligent wearable devices with learning algorithms inside to reconcile the reduced executive capacity of devices with the accuracy of models.

While supervised learning models are presented as a more agile solution, deep learning models usually appear more laborious but more accurate. 
This project compares both solutions to balance model capability and accuracy, aiming to propose a tool to support experts in the field during psychological therapies.
